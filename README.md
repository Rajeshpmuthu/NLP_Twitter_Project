# NLP_Twitter_Project
Twitter sentiment analysis -  NLP, logistic regression and deep learning. Data preprocessing and Exploration

**The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model using Deep Learning techniques to process Twitter data. The model will classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, enabling the analysis of public opinions and sentiments on various topics discussed on the Twitter platform**


**Objective**  - To build a robust Deep Learning-based sentiment analysis model capable of accurately categorizing tweets into different sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral). The model will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Deep Learning architectures to understand and predict sentiments from text data.

**Data Set Metrics:**

  Size: The dataset consists of 57 tweets collected over a specific period.
  
  Features: Includes tweet text, metadata (timestamps, user information, etc.).
  
  Distribution: Distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) within the dataset.
  
  Data Preprocessing: Details of cleaning steps, tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction.
  
  Model Metrics: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score on a separate validation or test dataset.
